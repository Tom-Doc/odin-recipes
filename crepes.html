            Crepe, also spelled crÃªpe, is a French pancake made of a thin batter containing 
            flour, eggs, melted butter, salt, milk, water, and, if the crepes are to 
            be served with a sweet sauce or garnish, sugar. Crepes can be filled with 
            a variety of sweet or savoury mixtures.

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
                <li>1/2 cup water</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter (melted)</li>
           </ul>
           <h4>Steps</h4>
           <ol>
               <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</li>
                <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
                <li>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.</li>
            </ol>
